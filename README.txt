The file "spanigrahi_FlyerFlo.py" is written in Python 2.7.4.

It requires the Beautiful Soup module (version 4.1.3) in order to run. This module is used to help parse the HTML code of the target URL.

On line 8, there is a value for the URL which can be modified to the necessary URL from which the Reddit alien image is to be downloaded.

The default value is the one given in the original e-mail, but can be modified to others such as "http://www.reddit.com/r/aww".

Once the code is run, it saves the subreddit alien image file in the same folder as the code.
